# Explorable Physics
This <a href="https://landgreen.github.io/physics/">site</a> contains course notes for algebra based physics with <a href="https://explorabl.es/">explorable</a> <a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/">explanations</a>. The explorables attempt to instill an intuitive understanding of physics, but mostly they are just fun.

I wrote it for my students, but it might be useful if you are learning or teaching physics.
I'm still adding content for 2019-2020. Let me know if you have any ideas or if you have found one of the numerous mistakes.
